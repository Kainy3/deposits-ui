                    Accessible design is everyone's responsibility, from information and user experience design, through to development, and on into help and support. It is about understanding the users' journeys and proactively anticipating their needs. <br /><br />
                    Accessibility of a digital product is a science of making sure the product is suitable for older users, visually impaired, color-blind, and others (including people on low contrast, low-quality displays). The general idea is that a digital product should be easy to "see" for everyone. <br /><br />
                    To make sure products are accessible to everyone, follow the four principles of the <span className='text-blue-600'> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG): </span><br /><br />
                    <b> Perceivable: </b>It can be perceived by at least one of a person's senses.<br />
                    <b> Operable: </b> All interactions are operable through a variation of input methods. <br />
                    <b>Understandable:</b>  Information and operation of the interface must be understandable. <br />
                    <b>Robust: </b> Content can be interpreted by a variety of assistive technologies and withstand changes in these technologies.

                    <Text>Keep content and accessibility text concise. Concise doesnâ€™t mean limited; it means something closer to efficient. Use as few words as possible without losing the meaning. When writing concisely, we make sure every word on the screen has a job. People using screen readers hear every UI element read aloud, so the shorter the text, the faster they can navigate the content. Screen readers can skim more easily and skip irrelevant paragraphs if you keep sentences short and frontload paragraphs with important information.</Text>
