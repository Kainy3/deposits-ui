            <p>Accessible design is everyone's responsibility, from information and user experience design, through to development, and on into help and support. It is about understanding the users' journeys and proactively anticipating their needs.</p>
            <p>Accessibility of a digital product is a science of making sure the product is suitable for older users, visually impaired, color-blind, and others (including people on low contrast, low-quality displays). The general idea is that a digital product should be easy to "see" for everyone.</p>
            <p>To make sure products are accessible to everyone, follow the four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):</p>
            <p>Perceivable: It can be perceived by at least one of a person's senses.<br /> Operable: All interactions are operable through a variation of input methods. <br /> Understandable: Information and operation of the interface must be understandable. <br /> Robust: Content can be interpreted by a variety of assistive technologies and withstand changes in these technologies.</p>

            <h3 className='text-2xl mb-4 font-semibold'>Color Use</h3>
            <p>Color components like brightness and saturation influence the contrast, which directly affects the readability. The higher the readability, the easier the product is to use for a wider group of people. Sufficient contrast levels help users with vision problems to be able to use the product as intended. We must remember to check the WCAG 2.0 contrast for all essential UI elements.</p>
